## Features

As a foundational web project, this application is set up to support:

-   **Component-Based UI:** Built with React for a modular and reusable user interface.
-   **Modern Styling:** Utilizes Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling, enabling rapid UI development.
-   **Accessible UI Components:** Integrates Radix UI primitives and Shadcn UI components for high-quality, accessible, and customizable UI elements.
-   **Client-Side Routing:** Configured with React Router DOM for seamless navigation within the application.
-   **Efficient Data Fetching:** Incorporates TanStack React Query for managing server state, caching, and optimizing data interactions.
-   **Fast Development Experience:** Powered by Vite for a quick development server and optimized builds.
-   **Code Quality:** Enforced with ESLint for maintaining consistent code style and catching potential issues.

## Technologies Used

-   **[React](https://react.dev/)**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-   **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)**: A fast build tool that provides a lightning-fast development experience.
-   **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
-   **[Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/)**: A collection of unstyled, accessible UI components for React.
-   **[Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)**: A collection of reusable components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.
-   **[React Router DOM](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)**: Declarative routing for React.
-   **[TanStack React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest)**: Powerful asynchronous state management for React.
-   **[ESLint](https://eslint.org/)**: Pluggable JavaScript linter.
-   **[clsx](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx)**: A tiny (229B) utility for constructing `className` strings conditionally.
-   **[lucide-react](https://lucide.dev/)**: A beautiful and consistent icon toolkit.
-   **[next-themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes)**: An abstraction for themes in Next.js (though used here in a Vite project).
-   **[sonner](https://sonner.emilkowalski.com/)**: An opinionated toast component for React.

## Getting Started

To get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (LTS version recommended)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/codegallantx/skill-relay
    cd skill-relay-web
    ```
2.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server with hot-reloading:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (or the port shown in your terminal) in your browser to see the application.

### Building for Production

To build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command bundles the React app into static files for deployment.

### Linting

To run ESLint and check for code quality issues:

```bash
npm run lint
```
